Member.

We’re a global community of entrepreneurs finding and funding solutions to the world’s most pressing problems. Every member, including myself, has made a legally binding commitment to donate a portion of personal proceeds on liquidity to social causes. The Founders Pledge team provides charity research and vetting, a global network of experts, and end-to-end giving infrastructure, and they take no cuts and charge no fees. They also host community events across the globe.
