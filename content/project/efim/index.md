Co-Patron.

Estonia's Friends International Meeting (EFIM) was called to life to thank and recognize business, political and cultural figures whose actions and advice have helped Estonia to become a truly European country with a dynamic economy and thriving culture.

We welcome our friends to Estonia to exchange ideas on the future of Estonia and to have a close look at our countryâ€™s ambitions, culture, nature, its business community and political decision-makers.

The invitees get access to intellectually stimulating business discussions, high profile government visits and a world-class cultural program.

Registration by invitations only.

The first Estonia's Friends International Meeting was held in August 2010 in Tallinn. The tradition was kicked off as a joint initiative by Enterprise Estonia, entrepreneur Mr Margus Reinsalu and former [President of Estonia Mr Toomas Hendrik Ilves](/project/presidentilves).
