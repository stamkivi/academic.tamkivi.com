Limited Partner.

Limitless backs companies who reduce harm for the planet, save lives & livelihoods.

Limitless is looking for scalable products and services tackling climate change, digital health or 
education, and backs passionate teams willing to pursue long-term meaningful goals.

The fund specialises in revenue based financing. This means that we prefer not to take a stake in your company, rather we take a percentage of the monthly revenue your business makes during a specific time span. 
We are interested in you building up a financially sustainable business
while creating as much positive impact as possible.

Founded and managed by Jorma Laiapea and Marge Maidla.
Backed by early [Transferwise](/project/transferwise) and [Skype](/project/skype) alumni.

Based in Tallinn, Estonia.
