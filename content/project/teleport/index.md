Co-founder & CEO, 2014-17.

Teleport built software for free people on the move.

I narrowed in on the human mobility topic during my research as an [EIR at a16z](/project/a16z). With like-minded co-founders Silver Keskk√ºla and Balaji S. Srinivasan we decided to create a company that helps individuals figure out what is the best place for them to live an work, and how do they get there.

We [raised at $2.6M seed round](https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/08/teleport-2/) from [Andreessen Horowitz](/project/a16z), [Seedcamp](/project/seedcamp), SV Angel and several angels and started broadly experimenting in this space, launching a location search engine and a series of adjacent consumer apps.

In 2017, Teleport was acquired by Move Guides (now [Topia](/project/topia)) to become the employee-facing part of its' enterprise global talent mobility management platform.
