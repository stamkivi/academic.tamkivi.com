Co-founder & partner in the 90s.

Forwards Studio was a legendary sound studio and indie label in Tartu, Estonia. Founded by Lauri Liivak in 1999.

The studio spawned from late night recording sessions of [Bizarre](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5mDPYVLb5yNwRvxK5yPRZJ?si=o_aBm7JITOeV4K57kXKy-Q), one of my favourite bands of all time. 

I became a partner when we bought the studio equipment from a local radio station, and besides recording and mastering services for bands, started to make money with radio ads and occasional sound production projects for multimedia projects at [Halo](/project/halo).
