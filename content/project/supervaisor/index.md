Supervaisor is building a better, AI-assisted world by fixing traffic.

Countless lives are lost in traffic every day and many more get disrupted because of accidents. Most of them we could have seen coming. Either through the eyes of the citizens or though thousands of sensors surrounding us. Our mission is to save lives in traffic by combining information from humans and AI agents. 

Imagine knowing that the next intersection has 10 times more red-light crossings than the rest of your commute
Imagine knowing where to change traffic order before lives are lost
Imagine knowing what behaviors actually lead to loss of lives
Imagine maps where each datapoint is backed by real world evidence
