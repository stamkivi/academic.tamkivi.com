Seed investor.

[Rendin][1] is building a platform that makes the whole process of home renting fast, fair and flexible.

We really believe that home renting should be as easy and seamless as hailing an Uber ride not like the mangled mess you usually have to go through today without Rendin.

As a first step on our journey we have already created the safest rental agreement in the world that replaces the 1-2 month security deposits with up to 100x more protection. Our current solution streamlines most parts of the rental agreement process from start-to-finish, meaning that:

 * As a tenant - you can have a safety net, peace of mind and significantly lower starting costs.
 * As a landlord - you will get payments, damages, legal protection and safer selection of tenants.
 * As a real estate agent - you get to cut down your working hours while making more deals at the same time.

Founded by Alain Aun, Maiko Saluorg and Alar MÃ¤erand.
