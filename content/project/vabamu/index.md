Supervisory Board member since April 2015. 

Vabamu Museum of Occupations and Freedom and its branch KGB Prison Cells are the largest active non-profit museum in Estonia. The museum is managed by the Kistler-Ritso Estonian Foundation.

The Vabamu Museum of Occupations and Freedom is a place that recounts the story of the Estonian people from occupation to independence and inspires people to maintain and stand up for their freedom. We educate, engage, and encourage Estonian people and visitors to reflect on recent history, feel the fragile nature of freedom, and stand up for liberty and justice.

Sten has been serving on board through the massive re-invention, re-building and re-branding of the museum launched in 2018.
