DAO member.

[Flamingo][3] is an NFT-focused DAO...

Wait, what?
* NFT = [non-fungible token][2]
* DAO = [decentralized autonomous organization][1]

Flamingo DAO explores emerging investment opportunities for ownable, blockchain-based assets. NFTs are not just cat pictures. They encompass digital art, collectibles, and in-game assets and other tangible assets. These new forms of digital property are poised to play an increasing role in helping to create, monetize, and incentivize online digital content.

NFTs are not interchangeable, and they thus introduce a new form of scarcity in the digital world. They can represent digital or real-world assets, providing verifiable proof of authenticity and ownership (assuming they are created by the original author or owner) using a blockchain network.

Flamingo is entirely member-directed and managed by the Members through democratic voting.
