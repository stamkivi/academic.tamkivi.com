Good Deed Education Fund is a philanthropy fund founded by the new generation of Estonian entrepreneurs.

Founded by Taavet Hinrikus of [Transferwise](/project/transferwise) and Martin Villig of [Bolt](/project/bolt) and has raised 1M EUR out of the gate, from about 30 Estonian entrepreneurs and tech companies.

We identified the following acute issues to address with the Education Fund:
* The lack of appeal of the profession of teaching as the average age of teachers is constantly increasing. 
* Quality of school leadership (recruitment, leadership, culture and goal setting; empowering parents board).
* The youth drop-out rate after the mandatory level (9 years); not graduating from the next education level. 
* The low levels of STEAM skills acquired from school. 

Good Deed Education Fund is looking for initiatives that addresses these problems in a measurable way. Through the initiatives we will be looking for ways to increase the quality of education together with leaders from different sectors - public, private, third sector.
