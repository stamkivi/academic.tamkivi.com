Promonos Capital is on a mission to build prosperous cities that uplift entire regions. We do this by working with citizens, states, and developers to upgrade laws and institutions for greater justice and well-being.

Decades of research on economic development has shown that the primary determinant of prosperity is the quality of a country’s laws and the integrity of its courts, administrators, and other legal institutions.

When institutions are outmoded, corrupted, or failing, the result is untold human suffering. Workers are trapped in low wage jobs and dangerous working environments, children don’t get educated, adults can’t get quality healthcare, and people can’t start businesses to support their families. Yet, upgrading national institutions is notoriously difficult, and consensus on country-level changes should be slow and deliberate.

Our solution? Build the cities of tomorrow.
‍
At Pronomos Capital, we’re using the lessons of Silicon Valley to create a new model for urban development where the city is the product. Our portfolio founders work in partnership with countries to create new communities that seek - through good governance - to emulate the economic success of Dubai, Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Singapore.
