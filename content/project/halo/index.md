The first digital media agency in Estonia. Founded in 1996 straight out of high school. Sold to [DDB Worldwide](https://www.ddb.com/) in 1997. Folded in 2001 along with dotcom bubble.

A Northern Star of its time, Halo spawned a few dozen influential early internet people (UX, design, web development, software engineering) who have had notable influence on the Estonian and European startup scene over the decade since.
