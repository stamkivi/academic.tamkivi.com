Seed Investor.

Career Karma is a community of peers, mentors and coaches that will help you land a dream career in Tech. You never pay a dime. The only cost is to help people behind you.

Career Karma is always free for students because after we coach you to prepare and get enrolled into a bootcamp in our network, the school pays us a placement fee for helping you.
